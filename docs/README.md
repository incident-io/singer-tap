## Getting started

[api-keys]: https://app.incident.io/settings/api-keys

Start by visiting your [incident dashboard][api-keys] to create an API key with
permission to:

- View data, like public incidents and organisation settings
- View catalog types and entries

If you want this tap to have access to private incident data, also include the
following scope:

- View all incident data, including private incidents

Once you've created the key, create a `config.json` file that you'll use to
configure the tap that looks like this:

```json
{
  "api_key": "<your-api-key"
}
```

You can check this works by running:

```console
$ tap-incident --discover --config=config.json
```

## Configuring exports

By default the tap will export all data it can.

If you want to control what fields and tables you wish to export you will need a catalog file. You can use the discover command to create a default catalog file which will contain all streams and columns along with their properties.

```console
$ tap-incident --discover --config=config.json > catalog.json
```

The catalog file follows the Singer specification to enable or disable a stream add the field `selected: <true|false>` inside the streams top level metadata. For example to disable exporting severities:

```json
{
  "streams": [
    {
      "stream": "severities",
      "tap_stream_id": "severities",
      "schema": {
        ...
      },
      "metadata": [
        {
          "breadcrumb": [],
          "metadata": {
            "selected": false, // Add this
            "inclusion": "available",
            "selected-by-default": true,
            "forced-replication-method": "FULL_TABLE"
          }
        },
        {
          "breadcrumb": [
            "properties",
            "id"
          ],
```

You can adjust which columns within a stream you wish to export similarly, by adding the same field inside the metadata for that column, for example to not export a description field:

```json
    {
      "breadcrumb": [
        "properties",
        "description"
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "inclusion": "available",
        "selected": false, // Add this
        "selected-by-default": true
      }
    },
```
